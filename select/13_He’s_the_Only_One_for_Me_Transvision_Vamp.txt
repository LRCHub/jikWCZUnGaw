I don't know what's gonna come
I just wanna see my baby run
Into my arms, my arms tonight
I don't mind if people stare
'Cause he's all mine and I don't care

He's the only one
Only one for me
He's the only one
Only one for me

I'd never fought(?) the clothes he wears
And I'd never change the style of his hair
I couldn't change anything

You keep saying he talks much too much
But I would say it's never enough

He's the only one
Only one for me
He's the only one
Only one for me
He's the only one
Only one for me

Sometimes he might act like a child
He's just having fun, if that's too wild
Well he's just not for you

I could try to make him tame
But then he just wouldnt be the same

He's the only one
Only one for me
He's the only one
Only one for me
He's the only one
Only one for me
He's the only one
Only one for me

I know people say they think its cool
But I now really gotta disaprove
Say what you like i won't be sore
'Cause he's the only boy worth living for

Yeah he's the only one

I know sometimes you can seen him as five (?)
But it always works out right
I didn't say anybody was perfect
'Cause when he's standing close to me
I don't care what you might see

'Cause he's the only
One only one for me
He's the only one
Only one for me
